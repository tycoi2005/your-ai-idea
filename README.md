# AI-Based Personalized Learning Companion

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The project aims to develop an AI-based personalized learning companion that can adapt to a student's learning style and pace, providing customized educational content and assessments.

## Background

This idea addresses several problems:
* Traditional education often follows a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not cater to individual learning styles.
* Students may need additional help outside of classroom hours.
* Personal tutors can be expensive and inaccessible to many students.

This topic is important as education is a fundamental right, and improving access to personalized learning can have significant societal benefits.

## How is it used?

The AI companion can be used by students of all ages for various subjects. It assesses the student's understanding of a topic through quizzes and interactive activities, then uses these insights to provide personalized content. Teachers and parents can also use it to track the student's progress.

!AI Learning Companion

Here's a simple example of how the AI might interact with a student:

```python
def main():
   # The AI asks the student a question
   print("What is 5 + 5?")
   
   # The student inputs their answer
   answer = input()
   
   # The AI checks the answer
   if answer == "10":
      print("Correct!")
   else:
      print("Sorry, that's not correct. Let's try another one.")

main()
```
# Data sources and AI methods
The AI would use machine learning algorithms to adapt to each student’s learning style. It could use data from the student’s interactions with the system, such as quiz scores, time spent on each topic, etc. Publicly available educational datasets could also be used to train the model.

# Challenges
The project does not solve issues related to internet access or availability of digital devices, which are necessary for using this tool. Ethical considerations include data privacy and ensuring that the AI does not discriminate against any group of students.

# What next?
The project could be expanded to include more advanced features like voice recognition or virtual reality. Skills needed would include machine learning, natural language processing, and app development.
